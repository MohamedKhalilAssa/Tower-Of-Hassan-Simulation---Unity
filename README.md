# 🏛️ Unity 3D Moroccan Monument Project

This Unity project showcases a 3D environment inspired by historical Moroccan architecture, featuring a central tower and surrounding columns. The player can move freely in the environment with smooth camera control, interaction logic, and animations.

## 📌 Project Description

This 3D scene replicates the **Hassan Tower**  recreating a culturally rich environment. The player can navigate using first-person or third-person controls, supported by a modular architecture and clean animation logic.
The purpose of this project is to promote our Moroccan heritage and demonstrate how digital tools and technology can be used to preserve our culture and traditions.
